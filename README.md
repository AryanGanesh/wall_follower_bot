Wall Follower Bot (ROS 2 Humble â€“ TurtleBot3 Simulation)










This project implements a Wall Follower robot in ROS 2 Humble using the TurtleBot3 platform. The robot moves forward, detects obstacles, and performs precise 90Â° turns by integrating odometry feedback with timer-based approximations.

The project was first tested in the TurtleBot World simulation and then extended to the more challenging CafÃ© World, where careful tuning led to smoother and more reliable navigation.

âœ¨ Features

Custom Python ROS 2 node for autonomous wall following

Odometry + Timer Approximation for precise 90Â° turns

Laser scan tuning (wider angles & thresholds) for earlier obstacle detection

Real-time sensor data logging for debugging and feedback

Tested in TurtleBot World and CafÃ© World simulations

ðŸ“Š Demo

TurtleBot World (Initial Testing): Early trials to test obstacle detection and turning.

CafÃ© World (Refined Simulation): Improved performance with tuned thresholds and scan coverage.

(Screenshots or GIFs of the simulation here would make it engaging!)
